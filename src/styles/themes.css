/* ============================= */
/* ðŸŽ¨ Theme System - Pure Tailwind CSS */
/* ============================= */

/* Theme classes are now handled entirely by Tailwind CSS with custom colors defined in tailwind.config.js */
/* All theme switching is done by changing the class on the html element */
/* Example: html.theme-purple, html.theme-green, html.theme-custom */

/* The actual theme overrides are defined in design-system.css using @apply directives */
/* This approach eliminates the need for CSS variables and uses pure Tailwind classes */

/* Theme switching is handled by React context and applies theme-specific classes */
/* See design-system.css for the actual theme implementations */
